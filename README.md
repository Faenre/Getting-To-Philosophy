# Getting To Philosophy

This script plays the _[Getting To Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy)_ game, recording the steps (or "hops") necessary to get from the beginning article towards the end.

The goal of the game is to "get to Philosophy" by following the first link of each page (with some exclusions), and counting how many "hops" it takes to get to the "Philosophy" page.

# Setup

This uses the BeautifulSoup, Regex, and Requests libraries, which you can install manually or via the requests.txt file:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage

Call from the command line by specifying either an article name or a page URL:

```sh
python3.9 ./getting_to_philosophy.py villain
python3.9 ./getting_to_philosophy.py "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain"
python3.9 ./getting_to_philosophy.py "Elizabeth I"
```

The script will crawl according to the rules specified in the game above:

```sh
‚ùØ python3.9 ./getting_to_philosophy.py "Villain"

Note that because Wikipedia is an evergreen project that constantly has contributions, it is possible that pages change even throughout the day. For example, the article about Thought [changed while I wrote this project](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thought&oldid=1230577918), then [reverted again overnight!](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thought&diff=1230692892&oldid=1230577918)
